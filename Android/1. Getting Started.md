## Anatomy of APK
APKs are like ZIP files that contain everything an android application needs to operate: the application code, the application manifest file, and the application's resources

### Main components of an Android APK
	* AndroidManifest.xml - contains the application’s package name, access rights, referenced libraries as well as other metadata.
	* classes.dex - contains the application source code compiled in .dex file format.
	* resources.arsc - contains the application’s precompiled resources.
	* res/ folder - contains the application's resources not compiled into resources.arsc.
	* lib/ folder - contains compiled code that is platform-dependent. Each subdirectory in lib/ contains the specific source code for respective processors.
	* assets/ folder - contains the application’s assets.
	* META-INF/ folder - contains the MANIFEST.MF file, which stores metadata about the application. It also contains the certificate and signature of the APK.
